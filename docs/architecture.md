# trailmix — architecture & structure

A portable, token-efficient agentic coding framework. One workflow — **Discuss → Plan →
Implement → Review → Document** — that runs on both **GitHub Copilot CLI (GHCP)** and
**Claude Code (CC)** from a single source.

Status: **implemented.** This document is the design source of truth; §11 tracks build progress.

Locked decisions: single neutral source + generator · soft rigidity (auto-trigger skills,
human checkpoint per phase, no gate engine) · single adaptive flow · always-on SessionStart
hook (injects the full AGENTS.md instruction file — the only always-on delivery mechanism) +
terse prose + lean code + GORP handoffs · marketplace-only install, no standalone installer ·
light theming (functional agent names, themed suite concepts).

---

## 1. Why skills-first is portable

Both CLIs share enough primitives that the methodology can be authored once:

| Primitive | CC | GHCP | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Skills** (`SKILL.md`, open standard) | `skills/` (plugin root, auto-namespaced) | `skills/` (plugin root, flat) | author once, ship to both |
| Custom agents | `agents/*.md` | `agents/*.agent.md` | generate per platform |
| Per-agent model | `sonnet/opus/haiku` | full model names, per-subagent settings | map from neutral tier |
| Tool names | `Read/Edit/Grep/Bash…` | `read/edit/search/shell…` (aliases) | map from neutral alias |
| JIT skill loading | yes | yes | core of the token strategy |
| **SessionStart hook** | `hooks/hooks.json`, matcher `startup\|resume\|clear\|compact` | `hooks/hooks.json`, `sessionStart` (no clear/compact equivalent) | the **only** always-on mechanism (see §12) |
| **AGENTS.md** | bundled reference only — **not auto-loaded from inside a plugin** | same — GHCP's native root-`AGENTS.md` read doesn't apply to plugin-bundled files | authored once, informs the hook message; not itself delivered |
| Plugins + marketplace | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (source → `./dist/claude`) | root `plugin.json` + root `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` (source → `./dist/ghcp`) | the only supported install path — no standalone installer |

Portable by construction: **skills** (methodology) and the **SessionStart hook** (the one
always-on instruction, kept deliberately short). Only mechanical differences (agent file shape,
model/tool vocab, hook JSON schema, manifest location) get hidden behind the generator.

## 2. Naming / theme glossary (light)

Agents keep **functional** names (clear descriptions drive dispatch). Suite concepts carry the
trail-mix flavor:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **trailmix** | the framework |
| **trailhead** | bootstrap/router skill — activates the system, points to the right waypoint |
| **waypoint** | one phase (discuss/plan/implement/review/document) |
| **trail crew** | the subagents collectively |
| **GORP** | the compact agent→agent handoff convention (internal name; keep it while it amuses) |
| artifact | a phase output file on disk (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `review.md`) — plain term, no theme |
| skills / skill library | the collection of trailmix skills — plain term, no theme |

Install is marketplace-only, no standalone installer: `/plugin marketplace add owner/repo` (CC)
/ `copilot plugin marketplace add owner/repo` (GHCP) read the root marketplace stubs above, which
point at `dist/claude/` and `dist/ghcp/` respectively. GHCP also supports installing
`dist/ghcp/` directly via `copilot plugin install owner/repo:dist/ghcp`, no marketplace step.

## 4. The trail — five waypoints (soft, adaptive)

Each waypoint is a skill that **auto-triggers on intent**, does its work (often via a subagent),
writes an **artifact to disk**, and **pauses for a human checkpoint**. No state machine. Adaptive:
for trivial work `trailmix-discuss`+`trailmix-plan` collapse into one `spec-plan.md`;
`trailmix-document` may legitimately produce nothing.

Artifacts live in the target project at: `.trailmix/trail/<feature-slug>/`.

| # | Waypoint (skill) | Does | Subagent / model tier | Artifact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **trailmix-trailhead** | Detect "we're building something", route to the right waypoint, name the feature slug | main | — |
| 1 | **trailmix-discuss** | Socratic spec refinement; research codebase + web; present in digestible chunks; smooth edge cases | **trailmix-explorer** (cheap) for research | `spec.md` |
| 2 | **trailmix-plan** | High-level design — interfaces, services, flows, endpoints, file map, contracts, tasks. **Not code blocks.** | main (may consult trailmix-explorer) | `plan.md` |
| 3 | **trailmix-implement** | Build + test, TDD, honor contracts; verify per `verification.md`; return capped evidence summary | **trailmix-implementer** (reasoning) | code + tests (git diff) |
| 4 | **trailmix-review** | Read-only review vs spec+plan; `review-checklist.md`; HIGH/MED/LOW + verdict; human picks fixes | **trailmix-reviewer** (strong, read-only) | `review.md` |
| 5 | **trailmix-document** | Weight-based doc updates (`weight-heuristics.md`); zero-doc is valid | **trailmix-documenter** (standard) | repo docs |

Fix loop: human selects findings (e.g. `H1, M2`) → `trailmix-implementer` applies exactly those →
re-review if needed. All handoffs use **GORP** (§6).

**Trail metadata & resume.** Each artifact carries minimal YAML frontmatter; `spec.md` /
`spec-plan.md` is the **anchor** (trail identity + the Document outcome, which has no artifact of
its own). The only non-derivable field is `status: draft | approved | superseded` — advancing a
waypoint stamps the previous artifact `approved`, so an abandoned trail shows its last artifact
`draft`. Both mechanical operations — reading **frontmatter only** (never bodies) to *resume* or
*survey status*, and *transitioning* a status — run through a bundled zero-dep Node helper
(`trailmix-trailhead/refs/trail.mjs`), so the LLM never hand-parses or hand-edits YAML and never
types a status value it could misspell — it names an intent and the helper owns the vocabulary
(the correctness + token win). Commands: `new` (scaffold an artifact's frontmatter — dates and
initial status correct by construction), the named transitions `approve`/`supersede`/
`document-done`/`document-skipped`, `read`, `check` (lint all frontmatter against the schema;
also run in CI via `verify.sh`), and `status` (derive the resume line per trail). The helper is a
**pure data tool** — it owns the closed vocabulary (statuses, waypoints, templates) but no
workflow rules: no gates, no enforced ordering, no state machine; even `status` only reports. The
skill decides when to call it. It ships inside the
plugin and is invoked by plugin-root path (`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` on CC / `$PLUGIN_ROOT` on GHCP),
**not** installed on PATH — so it's not the rejected `trailmix` CLI. Where neither var resolves
or `node` is absent, it falls back to an awk read pass / hand-edit. Schema + invocation live in
`trailmix-trailhead/refs/trail-metadata.md`. No sidecar `trail.json`, no state machine, no CLI.

---

## 5. The trail crew — agents (generated per platform)

Authored once as neutral `<name>.agent.md` (frontmatter + body); generator emits
`dist/claude/agents/<n>.md` and `dist/ghcp/agents/<n>.agent.md`, mapping `tier`→model and
neutral tools→platform tools; the markdown body carries over verbatim.

| Agent | Role | Tier | Tools (neutral) | Isolation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **trailmix-explorer** | Read codebase + web research, summarize | `cheap` | read, search, web | read-only |
| **trailmix-implementer** | Code + tests + verification | `reasoning` | read, edit, search, shell | read/write |
| **trailmix-reviewer** | Senior review, verdict | `strong` | read, search, shell | **read-only (discipline)** |
| **trailmix-documenter** | Update repo docs by weight | `standard` | read, edit, search, shell | read/write |

Neutral agent spec (example shape):

```yaml
name: trailmix-reviewer
description: Senior read-only reviewer. Reviews uncommitted work vs spec+plan; returns
  HIGH/MED/LOW findings with a verdict. Never edits.
tier: strong
tools: [read, search, shell]
returns: gorp        # handoff convention
```

---

## 6. GORP — the token-efficient handoff convention

Purpose: shrink **agent→agent** handoffs (never user-facing prose) losslessly. Phase 1 is a
**convention**, not a new parser — adopt a dense encoding later if measured worth it.

Rules (enforced by the `trailmix-gorp` skill + each agent's return contract):
- **Artifacts on disk, not in chat.** Return a pointer + a distilled summary; the human/orchestrator reads diffs and artifacts from the terminal.
- **Evidence = counts + exact commands**, never pasted logs or diffs. (`npm test → 46/46`, not the log.)
- **Findings one line each**: `id · file:line · what → why → fix` (stable ids `H1/M2/L3`).
- **Hard word caps** per return (trailmix-implementer ≤ ~400 words, trailmix-documenter ≤ ~300).
- **No preamble, no sign-off, no gratitude.**

Optional later: a real columnar/keyed encoding (à la honey/ESON) for large structured returns,
plus a lossy-but-recoverable sampler for huge uniform tool output.

---

## 7. Style skills — always-on seasoning (with hard safety carve-outs)

| Skill | From | Effect | Never compresses (carve-outs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **terse** | caveman | Answer-first prose, drop filler/hedging/narration | code, commands, errors, file paths — **verbatim** |
| **lean-code** | ponytail | YAGNI ladder: needs to exist? → stdlib → native → existing dep → one line → min block | input validation, error handling, auth, secrets, migrations, deletes, anything the user explicitly asked for |
| **gorp** | honey | Dense agent→agent handoffs (§6) | fires only agent-facing, never user answers |

These are the *default writing style*; they must be always-on to pay off. Carve-outs are
non-negotiable — **lazy ≠ broken.**

---

## 8. Instructions — `AGENTS.md` (bundled reference) + the SessionStart hook (the always-on core)

`src/instructions/AGENTS.md` is the single source for trailmix's always-on conventions —
bootstrap, style, tool conventions, security — kept tiny, detail pushed into skills (JIT). It is
copied verbatim into `dist/{claude,ghcp}/AGENTS.md` for humans browsing the installed plugin,
but **neither CLI auto-loads a file by this name (or `CLAUDE.md`) from inside an installed
plugin.** There is no standalone installer that would place it at a project/global root either
(marketplace-only install, decided after weighing it against a standalone installer). So
the bundled `AGENTS.md` file itself never reaches a live session.

The **only** always-on mechanism is the `SessionStart` hook: the *same* `AGENTS.md` content is
injected as `additionalContext` (CC: plain stdout; GHCP: `{"additionalContext": ...}` JSON) at
session start/resume (CC also covers `clear`/`compact`; GHCP has no equivalent for those two).
This mirrors how Superpowers' `SessionStart` hook injects its full `using-superpowers` meta-skill
rather than a short pointer (verified against the real repo) — trailmix initially shipped a
one-line reminder here, then expanded to the full body once that comparison surfaced that the
one-liner was the more conservative, unvalidated choice, not the pattern that's actually shown
to work. Because `AGENTS.md` is kept intentionally small (§8 title), this stays cheap per
session-boundary event; it is not resent on every turn.

Contents:
1. **Bootstrap** — trailmix is active; consult **trailhead** for any build/change/fix/ship
   request; before any build task pull the matching **waypoint** skill; artifacts live in
   `.trailmix/trail/<slug>/`.
2. **Style defaults** — terse prose + lean code with the §7 carve-outs.
3. **Tool conventions** — prefer `rg`/`fd`/`bat`/`jq`/`sg` with silent fallbacks (from refs).
4. **Security constraints** — never read `.env`; no bulk env-var reads; no HTTP POST without
   explicit per-request permission (from refs). These override everything.

---

## 9. The generator — hiding the differences

`build/generate.mjs` reads `src/` and writes `dist/claude/` + `dist/ghcp/`.

**Skills:** copy `SKILL.md` near-verbatim to both; neutral frontmatter uses only the common
subset (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`). Platform-only extras (CC `model`/`paths`/`hooks`)
are emitted **only** into the CC copy from optional neutral hints. `refs/` copied as-is (JIT).

**Agents:** neutral yaml → CC `<n>.md` and GHCP `<n>.agent.md`, mapping `tier`→model and
neutral tools→platform tools.

**Model tiers** (`build/maps/models.json`, indicative — pin exact names at build time):

| tier | CC | GHCP |
|---|---|---|
| cheap | `haiku` | `claude-haiku-4.5` / `gpt-5-mini` |
| standard | `sonnet` | `claude-sonnet-4.6` |
| reasoning | `sonnet` (or `opus`) | `gpt-5.3-codex` / `claude-sonnet` |
| strong | `opus` | `claude-opus-4.x` / `gpt-5.5` |

**Tool aliases** (`build/maps/tools.json`): neutral set mirrors GHCP aliases; map to CC caps.

| neutral | CC | GHCP |
|---|---|---|
| read | `Read` | `read` |
| edit | `Edit, Write` | `edit` |
| search | `Grep, Glob` | `search` |
| shell | `Bash` | `shell` |
| web | `WebSearch, WebFetch` | `web` |
| task | `Task` | `agent` |
| todo | `TodoWrite` | `todo` |

**Instructions:** `AGENTS.md` is copied into each `dist/<platform>/AGENTS.md` as a bundled copy
(see §8) — not installed anywhere else, since there's no standalone installer. The same content
also becomes the `SessionStart` hook's payload (below).

**Hooks:** `AGENTS.md`'s content renders into each platform's `hooks/hooks.json` with a
different JSON shape per §1's table (shell-quoted for CC's plain-stdout `command`; JSON-wrapped
and shell-quoted again for GHCP's `bash`/`powershell` fields — always via `printf '%s'`, never
`echo`, since POSIX `sh`/`dash` interpret backslash escapes in `echo`'s argument by default while
`bash` doesn't, which silently corrupted the embedded JSON under `dash` until caught by testing).
CC's manifest doesn't need a `hooks` field (auto-discovered from the default `hooks/` folder like
`skills/`/`agents/`), GHCP's `plugin.json` must declare `"hooks": "hooks/hooks.json"` explicitly
(no default-folder convention there).

---

## 10. Token efficiency — where each lever lives

| Lever | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| JIT loading | tiny `SKILL.md`; detail in `refs/*.md` loaded only when the skill needs it |
| Context isolation | phase work runs in subagents; parent context stays clean |
| Disk over chat | artifacts (`spec/plan/review.md`) written to `.trailmix/…`; human reads them, not the context |
| Cheap-model routing | explorer/read/summarize/websearch on `cheap`; implement on `reasoning`; review on `strong` |
| Evidence not logs | GORP: counts + exact commands + one-line findings, hard word caps |
| Terse + lean defaults | always-on style skills with safety carve-outs |
| Tool-def deferral | rely on each CLI's native deferred tool loading when >~30 tools |

---

## 11. Build order (skills-first, plugin later)

1. ✅ `AGENTS.md` + `trailmix-trailhead` + the three style skills (`trailmix-terse`,
   `trailmix-lean-code`, `trailmix-gorp`) — instant value, fully portable.
2. ✅ Waypoint skills `trailmix-discuss` → `trailmix-plan` → `trailmix-implement` →
   `trailmix-review` → `trailmix-document` with their `refs/`.
3. ✅ Neutral agent specs + `generate.mjs` + maps → `dist/`.
4. ✅ `install.sh`/`install.ps1` (detect CLI, copy into target) — **removed**; marketplace-only
   install now, no standalone installer maintained.
5. ✅ `evals/` skill-behavior tests — manual scenario checklists (no harness); each is a
   paste-the-prompt / PASS-if / FAIL-if scenario run in a fresh session per CLI. Includes an
   install round-trip checklist. Grading is human judgment; running them is left to the user.
6. ✅ Package `dist/*` as plugins (`plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` per platform, plus root
   marketplace stubs so `owner/repo` marketplace-add resolves); publish to CC + GHCP
   marketplaces (publishing pending live verification).
7. ✅ `SessionStart` hook — the always-on core, replacing the root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`
   delivery `install.sh` used to provide.
8. ✅ Resumable trails — artifact frontmatter (anchor `spec.md`) + `trailhead` resume/status
   behavior, reading frontmatter only. Read + named status transitions go through a bundled
   zero-dep helper (`trail.mjs`, plugin-root-invoked, awk/hand-edit fallback) so YAML is never
   hand-edited and statuses are never typed by hand (can't be misspelled); it's a pure data tool
   that owns the status vocabulary but no transition rules — not a state machine or a PATH CLI.
   No `trail.json` (see §4).

---

## Open questions
- None blocking. To pin at build time: exact model names per tier, and whether `dist/` is
  committed or generated on install.
